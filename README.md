## Roadmap

- GUI Version:
        
    * Design and develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the program.
        Ensure the GUI is intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to perform all tasks easily.

    * Implement features such as buttons, input fields, and menus to replicate the functionality of the command-line interface.

 - Cross-Platform Compatibility:

    * Adapt the program to run seamlessly across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

    * Utilize cross-platform libraries and frameworks such as Tkinter (Python), Electron (JavaScript), or JavaFX (Java) for GUI development.

    * Test the application thoroughly on each platform to ensure consistent behavior and performance.

- Mobile Version:

    * Create a mobile-friendly version of the program for iOS and Android platforms.

    * Consider using frameworks like React Native (JavaScript), Flutter (Dart), or Xamarin (C#) for cross-platform mobile app development.

    * Optimize the user interface for smaller screens, touch input, and mobile navigation patterns.

    * Implement features like responsive design, offline access, and integration with mobile device features (e.g., biometric authentication).

- Syncing and Cloud Storage:

    * Enable users to sync their data across devices securely.

    * Implement cloud storage integration (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) to store encrypted user data.

    * Develop synchronization mechanisms to ensure data consistency and integrity across multiple devices.

- Enhanced Security Features:

    * Strengthen encryption algorithms and key management practices to enhance security.

    * Implement additional security features such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition).

    * Provide options for users to set up recovery methods or backup codes in case of lost access.

- Localization and Internationalization:

    * Translate the program into multiple languages to cater to a global audience.

    * Support localization features such as date formats, currency symbols, and language preferences.

    * Ensure the program's user interface is culturally sensitive and accessible to users from different regions.

- Community Feedback and Iteration:

    * Gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement and prioritize new features.

    * Continuously iterate on the program based on user suggestions, bug reports, and usability testing.
        
    * Maintain an active community forum or feedback channel to engage with users and address their concerns promptly.
